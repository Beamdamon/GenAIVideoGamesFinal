            <h1>Generative AI in Video Games: Ethics</h1>
            <hr>
        </div>
        <p>
            As with any use case of generative AI, there are also many ethical concern's for its use in the video game industry. Below is a list of some of the major concerns surrounding
            its use.
        </p>
        <div class="ethical-concerns-list">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Bias</b> - As AI is trained on a dataset, biases can often be present. This could lead to the creation of art, voicelines, and dialogue that reinforce sterotypes, descrmination, and
                    other forms of bias. It will be of utmost importance for any developer using AI to develop their video game, to ensure that their dataset is as bias free as possible.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Job loss</b> - The use of AI in video game developement can lead to a loss of potential jobs for artists, voice actors, and even developers. Voice cloning, or the
                    use of AI to clone a human voice, can also lead to the exploitation of the person whose voice was cloned.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Loss of Human Creativity</b> - If models lack proper diversity, the use of generative AI can result in outcome homogenization. Outcome homogenization is when the outcome 
                    of generative AI becomes extremely similar. This could potentially lead to a lack of creativity in the art, voice acting, and dialogue within a game. Generative AI usage could
                    also lead to a lack of cohesiveness in art and direction within a game if not properly handled.
