            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Unsecure Code</b> - Utilizing generative AI for the creation of code can lead to the application being at risk for injection based attack.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Data Privacy</b> - The data being used to train the AI can contain personal and private information. If users could exploit the AI,
