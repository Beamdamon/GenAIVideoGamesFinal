            <h1>Generative AI in Video Games: Background </h1>

        <p>
            Before diving into the use of generative AI within the industry, it is important to discern generative AI from that of the historically termed "AI" used in video games. 
            Players and devlopers have often refered to computer controlled enemies and opponents as "AI". Despite the term, these AI are very different than the machine learning
            AI that we often refer to today. These AI often use pre-programmed movements or utilize rule-based algortihms based off the player's actions to respond accordingly. They do not utilize 
            machine learning like our modern day AI. This form of AI has been used since the early days of video games, and is still used in the creation of modern video games.

                responses to the use of AI in video games.
